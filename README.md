[Live Demo](https://memory-game.giridharhackclu.repl.co/) and [Source Code](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/Memory-Game#index.html).

## How to play...

Memory Game has long been a favorite game for all generations. It is easy to play, in fact it is so simple that really young children can play with ease.
It requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win.

### Rules

* You will start by flipping over one card
* If the next card you flip matches, you get +1 to your score
* These cards then disappear
* If the next card you flip does not match, the cards flip back
* The game continues until you match all the cards on the board

## Prerequisites
